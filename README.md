Project Overview
In the realm of music notation, the automated recognition of musical notes is a fascinating application of deep learning. This project aims to classify different music symbols representing notes using a CNN model. The trained model can provide insights into the types of notes present in sheet music.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and validation comes from the Music Notes Datasets available on Kaggle. It contains five different music symbols:

Whole Note
Half Note
Quarter Note
Eight Note
Sixteenth Note
Each category consists of 1000 data samples, with 800 for training and 200 for validation.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-note-classification.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd music-note-classification
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Train the CNN model on the provided dataset:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Run the GUI application to classify musical notes from images:

bash
Copy code
python gui.py
The GUI application allows you to upload an image containing a musical note, predicts its class, and provides a description of the note.

Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used for music note classification is as follows:
